        <p>
            With the impact of COVID-19 epidemic, more and more users are relying on streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc.
            This resulted in the decline of customer base for dedicated stores that provided hard copy of both old &amp; new movie to customers
            and theater where they only Premiere the latest show that will eventually exist in one of the streaming service but at a significantly cheaper price.
            Soon, we believe that in the future the average film enjoyer will be completely dependent on streaming services.
            But relying on streaming services also has its downside, such as the lack of control, the customer will have no say in the subscription price, what shows is on and will be pulled.
            Another downside is the sheer number of streaming services, this will slowly adds-up to an unbearable monthly payment.

            Hence, Filmware aim to provide movie lovers with a site that allows user to completely own the product they've purchased.
            Replacing both the need of a physical movie store and the need to subscribe to multiple movies services without owning a single movie or film.
            With Filmwarem, the user can download the purchased shows and watch them offline anywhere they want, while also can keep tab on whats the latest show is on our website.
